# ⏰ Interactive Digital Stopwatch

A clean and functional stopwatch application built using core web technologies. This project demonstrates real-time timing logic using JavaScript's `setInterval()` function and a responsive user interface.

## ✨ Features
* **Time Tracking:** Accurately tracks time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
* **Controls:** Includes **Start/Play**, **Pause**, and **Reset** functionality.
* **Modern UI:** Features a centered design with a background image and a transparent overlay (`backdrop-filter`) for a clean, modern look.
* **Material Icons:** Uses Google Material Icons for clear and intuitive controls.

## 💻 Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Structure and content, including icon links.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling, including visual effects and layout (`flexbox`).
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Implements all timing logic (`setInterval()`, `clearInterval()`) and updates the time display in real-time.
